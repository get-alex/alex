# Contributing

Have a feature request?  Found a bug?  Awesome, and in the latter case, sorry!

Is this your first time contributing to open-source?  Cool!  Don’t be alarmed,
and don’t hold back.

Issues can be opened on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/wooorm/alex/issues).

For bugs, please provide detailed information on how to reproduce your
problems, what version of **alex** you’re on, what happened, and what you
expected to happen.

For feature requests, provide what problem should be solved and how it should
be solved.

If you think you can solve the bug or implement the feature yourself, let me
know, I’d love to help.
