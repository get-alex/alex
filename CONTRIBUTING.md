1. Browse the Alex repository.
2. Have a look at the issues and if you are interested in any issue then fork the repository.
3. Now clone the repository from your own account.
4. Always make your own branch on the repository and make changes on that.
5. Never make changes on master directly.
6. Do the necessary changes in the code needed to solve the problem.
7. Push it on the github and as you push it will show you that branch can be merged or not.
8. It is judged based on some test written by repository holder.
9. Your code changes should withstand those tests.
10. If you pass the test and have no conflict with master then it will show mergable.
11. You can click on "open pull request" button to open PR and contribute.
12. When you click, it will ask for a message.

14. Finally click on "open pull request" button.
15. Either repository holder will directly pull the changes or will tell you to do some changes.
