## Ecosystem

This project, `alex`, is a small wrapper around the [unified][] ecosystem.
It mainly uses [`retext`][retext] to process natural language, with the
[`retext-equality`][equality] and [`retext-profanities`][profanities] plugins.
For markdown, [`remark`][remark] is used.

Try and pick the right place to contribute to so we can help you faster.
`alex` handles the user‚Äôs command line experience, while the `retext`
plugins determine the rules and recommendations.

## Trying out your local changes

To see how your local changes affect `alex`, you can use
[npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)

```sh
git clone <your fork url>
cd alex
npm install
npm link

## Contributions

There‚Äôs several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Improve documentation

As a user of this project you‚Äôre perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren‚Äôt reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues

We‚Äôre always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.  It‚Äôs often good to first create an issue
to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to
prevent you from doing unnecessary work.

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues
*   Try to find the best issue tracker ([`remark`][remark], [`retext`][retext],
    [`retext-equality`][equality], [`retext-profanities`][profanities], or here)
    for your issue
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Ensure you‚Äôre using the latest version of projects
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the more we will
*   The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
    you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
*   Don‚Äôt include unrelated changes
*   Lint and test before submitting code by running `$ npm test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    it‚Äôs your job to convince us
