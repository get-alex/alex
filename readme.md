> üìù **alex** ‚Äî Catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing.

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis] [![Coverage Status][codecov-badge]][codecov]

Whether your own or someone else‚Äôs writing, **alex** helps you find gender
favouring, polarising, race related, religion inconsiderate, or other
**unequal** phrasing in text.

For example, when `We‚Äôve confirmed his identity` is given to **alex**,
it will warn you and suggest using `their` instead of `his`.

> Suggestions, feature requests, and issues are more than welcome!

Give **alex** a spin on the [Online demo ¬ª][demo].

## Command Line

![Example of how alex looks on screen][screenshot]

Let‚Äôs say `example.md` looks as follows:

```markdown
The boogeyman wrote all changes to the **master server**. Thus, the slaves
were read-only copies of master. But not to worry, he was a cripple.
```

Now, run **alex** on `example.md`:

```sh
$ alex example.md
```

Yields:

```txt
example.md
   1:5-1:14  warning  `boogeyman` may be insensitive, use `boogey` instead                       boogeyman-boogeywoman  retext-equality
  1:42-1:48  warning  `master` / `slaves` may be insensitive, use `primary` / `replica` instead  master-slave           retext-equality
  1:69-1:75  warning  Don‚Äôt use ‚Äúslaves‚Äù, it‚Äôs profane                                           slaves                 retext-profanities
  2:52-2:54  warning  `he` may be insensitive, use `they`, `it` instead                          he-she                 retext-equality
  2:61-2:68  warning  `cripple` may be insensitive, use `person with a limp` instead             cripple                retext-equality

‚ö† 5 warnings
```

See `$ alex --help` for more information.

> When no input files are given to **alex**, it searches for markdown and
> text files in the current directory, `doc`, and `docs`.

## API

[npm][]:

```sh
$ npm install alex --save
```

**alex** is also available as an AMD, CommonJS, and globals module,
[uncompressed and compressed][releases].

### `alex(value[, allow])`

### `alex.markdown(value[, allow])`

###### Example

```js
alex('We‚Äôve confirmed his identity.').messages;
/*
 * [ { [1:17-1:20: `his` may be insensitive, use `their`, `theirs`, `them` instead]
 *   message: '`his` may be insensitive, use `their`, `theirs`, `them` instead',
 *   name: '1:17-1:20',
 *   file: '',
 *   reason: '`his` may be insensitive, use `their`, `theirs`, `them` instead',
 *   line: 1,
 *   column: 17,
 *   location: { start: [Object], end: [Object] },
 *   fatal: false,
 *   ruleId: 'her-him',
 *   source: 'retext-equality' } ]
 */
```

###### Parameters

*   `value` ([`VFile`][vfile] or `string`)
    ‚Äî Markdown or plain-text;
*   `allow` (`Array.<string>`, optional)
    ‚Äî List of allowed rules.

###### Returns

[`VFile`][vfile].  You‚Äôll probably be interested in its
[`messages`][vfile-message] property, as demonstrated in the example
above, as it holds the possible violations.

### `alex.text(value)`

Works just like [`alex()`][alex-api], but does not parse as markdown
(thus things like code are not ignored)

###### Example

```js
alex('The `boogeyman`.').messages; // []

alex.text('The `boogeyman`.').messages;
/*
 * [ { [1:6-1:15: `boogeyman` may be insensitive, use `boogey` instead]
 *   message: '`boogeyman` may be insensitive, use `boogey` instead',
 *   name: '1:6-1:15',
 *   file: '',
 *   reason: '`boogeyman` may be insensitive, use `boogey` instead',
 *   line: 1,
 *   column: 6,
 *   location: Position { start: [Object], end: [Object] },
 *   fatal: false,
 *   ruleId: 'boogeyman-boogeywoman',
 *   source: 'retext-equality' } ]
 */
```

## Support

**alex** checks for many patterns of English language, and warns for:

*   Gendered work-titles, for example warning about `garbageman` and suggesting
    `garbage collector` instead;
*   Gendered proverbs, such as warning about `like a man` and suggesting
    `bravely` instead, or `ladylike` and suggesting `courteous`;
*   Blunt phrases, such as warning about `cripple` and suggesting
    `person with a limp` instead;
*   Intolerant phrasing, such as warning about using `master` and `slave`
    together, and suggesting `primary` and `replica` instead;
*   Profanities, the least of which being `butt`.

See [**retext-equality**][equality] and [**retext-profanities**][profanities]
for all checked rules.

**alex** ignores words meant literally, so `‚Äúhe‚Äù`, `He ‚Äî ...`, and [the
like][literals] are not warned about

## Ignoring files

**alex** CLI searches for files with a markdown or text extension when given
directories (e.g., `$ alex .` will find `readme.md` and `foo/bar/baz.txt`).
To prevent files from being found by **alex**, add an
[`.alexignore`][alexignore] file.

## `.alexignore`

The **alex** CLI will sometimes [search for files][ignoring-files].  To prevent
files from being found, add a file named `.alexignore` in one of the
directories above the current working directory.  The format of these files is
similar to [`.eslintignore`][eslintignore] (which is in turn similar to
`.gitignore` files).

For example, when working in `~/alpha/bravo/charlie`, the ignore file can be
in `charlie`, but also in `~`.

The ignore file for [this project itself][.alexignore]
looks as follows:

```txt
# `node_modules` is ignored by default.
example.md
```

## Ignoring messages

### `.alexrc`

### `package.json`

**alex** can silence messages through `.alexrc` configuration:

```json
{
  "allow": ["boogeyman-boogeywoman"]
}
```

...or the `alex` field in `package.json`:

```txt
{
  ...
  "alex": {
    "allow": ["butt"]
  },
  ...
}
```

The `allow` field is expected to be an array of rule identifier strings.

All `allow` fields in all `package.json` and `.alexrc` files are
detected and used when processing.

Next to `allow`, `noBinary` can also be passed.  Setting it to true
counts `he and she`, `garbageman or garbagewoman` and similar pairs
as errors, whereas the default (`false`), treats it as OK.

### Control

Sometimes, **alex** makes mistakes:

```markdown
A window will pop up.
```

Yields:

```txt
readme.md
  1:15-1:18  warning  `pop` may be insensitive, use `parent` instead  dad-mom  retext-equality

‚ö† 1 warning
```

**alex** can silence message through HTML comments in markdown:

```markdown
<!--alex ignore dad-mom-->

A window will **not** pop up.
```

Yields:

```txt
readme.md: no issues found
```

`ignore` turns off messages for the thing after the comment (in this
case, the paragraph).
It‚Äôs also possible to turn off messages after a comment by using
`disable`, and, turn those messages back on using `enable`:

```markdown
<!--alex disable dad-mom-->

A window will **not** pop up.

A window will **not** pop up.

<!--alex enable dad-mom-->

A window will pop up.
```

Yields:

```txt
readme.md
  9:15-9:18  warning  `pop` may be insensitive, use `parent` instead  dad-mom  retext-equality

‚ö† 1 warning
```

Multiple messages can be controlled in one go:

```md
<!--alex disable he-her his-hers dad-mom-->
```

...and all messages can be controlled by omitting all rule identifiers:

```md
<!--alex ignore-->
```

## Workflow

The recommended workflow is to add **alex** to `package.json`
and to run it with your tests in Travis.

You can opt to ignore warnings through [alexrc][] files and
[control comments][control].  For example, with a `package.json`.

A `package.json` file with [npm scripts][npm-scripts],
and additionally using [AVA][] for unit tests, could look
as follows:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test-api": "ava",
    "test-doc": "alex",
    "test": "npm run test-api && npm run test-doc"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "alex": "^1.0.0",
    "ava": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

Alternatively, if you‚Äôre using Travis to test, set up something
like the following in your `.travis.yml`:

```diff
 script:
 - npm test
+- alex --diff
```

Make sure to still install alex though!

If the `--diff` flag is used, and Travis is detected, unchanged
lines are ignored.  Using this workflow, you can merge PRs
with warnings, and not be bothered by them afterwards.

It‚Äôs a nice androgynous/unisex name, it was free on npm, I like it!  :smile:
