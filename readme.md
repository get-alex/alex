>   📝 **alex** — Catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing.

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/wooorm/alex.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/wooorm/alex) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/wooorm/alex.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/wooorm/alex) [![Code Climate](http://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/wooorm/alex.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wooorm/alex)

Whether your own or someone else’s writing, **alex** helps you find gender
favouring, polarising, binary thinking, identity insensitive, race related,
religion inconsiderate, or other **unequal** phrasing.

<!--lint disable no-html-->

For example, when `We’ve confirmed his identity` is given to **alex**,
it will warn you and suggest using `their` instead of `his`<sup>†</sip>.

† - Yes, using
`they` here is standard English since the 16<sup>th</sup> century, and was
used by Shakespeare.

## Command Line

![Example of how alex looks on screen](screen-shot.png)

Let’s say `example.md` looks as follows:

```markdown
All changes are written to the **master server**. The slaves are read-only
copies of master. When an _incoming message_ is given to the master, he
propagates through to the slaves.
```

Then, run **alex** on `example.md`:

```sh
alex example.md
```

Yields:

```text
example.md
  1:34  warning  `master` / `slaves` may be insensitive, use `primary` / `replica` instead
  2:70  warning  `he` may be insensitive, use `they`, `it` instead
```

See `alex --help` for more information.

## Programmatic

### alex(value)

**Example**

```js
alex('We’ve confirmed his identity.').messages;
/*
 * [ { [1:17-1:20: `his` may be insensitive, use `their`, `theirs` instead]
 *   name: '1:17-1:20',
 *   file: '',
 *   reason: '`his` may be insensitive, use `their`, `theirs` instead',
 *   line: 1,
 *   column: 17,
 *   fatal: false } ]
 */
```

**Parameters**

*   `value` ([`VFile`](https://github.com/wooorm/vfile) or `string`) —
    Markdown or plain-text.

**Returns**

[`VFile`](https://github.com/wooorm/vfile). You’ll probably be interested
in its [`messages`](https://github.com/wooorm/vfile#vfilemessages) property, as
demonstrated in the example above, as it holds the possible violations.

## Editors

*   Atom — [atom-linter-alex](https://github.com/wooorm/atom-linter-alex).

## Support

**Alex** checks for many patterns of English language, and warns for:

*   Gendered work-titles, for example warning about `garbageman` and suggesting
    `garbage collector` instead;

*   Gendered proverbs, such as warning about `like a man` and suggesting
    `bravely` instead, or `ladylike` and suggesting `courteous`;

*   Blunt phrases, such as warning about `cripple` and suggesting
    `person with a limp` instead;

*   Intolerant phrasing, such as warning about using `master` and `slave`
    together, and suggesting `primary` and `replica` instead.

## Globbing

```sh
alex $(git ls-files | awk '/.(md|txt)$/')
```

There’s no native support for globbing yet, but Unix is awesome. The above
script will process all by git known (and not ignored) files with an `md` or
`txt` extension.
